# Java AOC
These are the solutions (hopefully) for most of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

I'm using Java for my AP Comp Sci class. Other branches will contain other languages

## Running
I use Intellij, so maybe everything's all set up when you clone?

Make sure to change out the Resources folder to your own inputs!

## Code Efficiency
The goal here is to solve the problem, but not to make it as efficient as possible. I have been solving these in other languages, and a more efficient solution is desired. However, that does not mean I wish to implement the most efficient solution, what's more important is that the solution is understandable.
